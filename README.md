# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the required libraries.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Define X and Y array.
4. Define a function for costFunction,cost and gradient.
5. Define a function to plot the decision boundary. 6.Define a function to predict the 
   Regression value.
## Program:
